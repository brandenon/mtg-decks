# MTG Decks

This is a collection of my Magic the Gathering decks, posted here so I can take advantage of git's version control and have an easier time tracking deck changes and committing them to  my physical decks. I am also hoping to create some automation in the future since I am going back and forth between Manabox and Archidekt, and now Github as well.
